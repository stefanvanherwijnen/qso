# Install
Clone the repository and run
`pnpm i` or the npm/yarn install commands.

# Build
`pnpm exec quasar-vite build`

# Dev server
`pnpm exec quasar-vite dev`

## Serve
For now, if you have Quasar CLI installed, you can use [serve](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/commands-list#serve) to spin up a server:
```
quasar serve dist/spa
```
Or you can use your own server.
